Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines knowledge retrieval with a generative language model. 
It allows the chatbot to answer questions using external documents, not just its internal knowledge. 
The process involves embedding documents, storing them in a vector database like FAISS, 
and retrieving the most relevant chunks for question answering.
